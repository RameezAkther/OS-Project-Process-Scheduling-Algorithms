# OS-Project-Process-Scheduling-Algorithms
This repo consists of Process Scheduling algorithms in C language and it's documentation
Implemented Algorithms:<br>
1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)
2. SJF (Shortest Job First)
3. SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
4. Round Robin
5. Priority Preemptive
6. Priority Non Preemptive
<br>
Each algorithm is simulated with user-provided inputs for the number of processes, arrival times, burst times, and in some cases, priority levels. The program calculates and displays key metrics for each process, including completion time, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. It also calculates and displays the average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for each scheduling algorithm. Additionally, the program generates a Gantt chart to visually represent the order and duration of process execution.<br><br>
